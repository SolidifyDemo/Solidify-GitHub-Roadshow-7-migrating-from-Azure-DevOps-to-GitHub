# Solidify GitHub Roadshow 7, migrating from Azure DevOps to GitHub

## Details ##
Many of you have probably used Azure DevOps/TFS for years and have invested a lot of effort and time in it, maybe you are starting to use GitHub for some part of your development.

This 7:th roadshow event it’s time to show you how to migrate the artifacts you want from Azure DevOps to GitHub. We will go through topics like:

* Moving Azure Repos to GitHub
* Converting Team Foundation version control (TFVC) and Source Safe to Git and moving them to GitHub
* Moving Azure Pipelines YAML to GitHub YAML
* Azure Artifacts to GitHub packages
* What’s different between Azure Boards and GitHub Issues and how could/should you move
* What about Test Cases, are there any alternatives here?
